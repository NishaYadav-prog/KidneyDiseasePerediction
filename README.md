# KidneyDiseasePerediction
🧾 Description
This project is a Kidney Disease Prediction Web Application built using Flask (Python Web Framework) and Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and more. The system predicts whether a person is likely to suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on several medical features such as blood pressure, blood urea, serum creatinine, etc.

The goal is to provide early detection using ML models and a user-friendly interface to assist in preliminary diagnosis — especially helpful for medical students, researchers, and small clinics.
